I can not manipulate with github project of our company when I use my coworker's computer since it has the info of his.

When you have to log in company and personal github account with your company and personal computer:

even use git config --global user.name "userName" and
         git config --global user.email "userEmail"
to change it with your own username, it doesn't work.

So we have to delte previews Windows Credential or Mac KeyChain github account!
